# Artfinity
Artfinity is an art traceability and security monitoring system based on block chain technology. By recording the whole process of art creation from artists to the circulation of successive holders on the block chain, using IOT equipment, NFC information acquisition and identification technology, and combining with the technical characteristics of decentralization and non-tampering of the block chain, the traceability system of art can eliminate the problem of fraud in the art market.
